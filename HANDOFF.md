# HANDOFF — Commodity Desk (brief for the next agent)

## What this is
A free, self-hosted **commodity + global-macro dashboard**. Two tabs: **COMMODITIES** and **MACRO**. It gives each commodity segment and each macro country an adaptive, plain-English read with trade ideas — plus charts, curves, supply data, live ships and a news/fundamentals scanner.

- **Live:** https://oil-market-desk.onrender.com
- **Repo:** https://github.com/marlonbenedicttan-dotcom/oil-market-desk (public, auto-deploys on push to `main`)
- **Local:** `~/projects/oil-basis` · run with `npm start` → http://localhost:4173
  - **Node is at `~/.local/node/bin/node`** (not on the default PATH) — `export PATH="$HOME/.local/node/bin:$PATH"` first.
- **Stack:** zero-dependency Node (built-in `http`, `fetch`, `WebSocket`) + vanilla JS/Chart.js + Leaflet. Node ≥ 22.

## Architecture
```
server.js         the whole backend (HTTP server + all data logic + schedulers)  ~1,800 lines
src/lib.js        pure helpers (unit-tested): sgn, inBox, haversineNm, isoWeek, monthly,
                  pctOver, percentile, realizedVol, computeCracks, backAdjust, pearson, logReturns
public/index.html tabs + panels (2 tabs: COMMODITIES, MACRO)
public/app.js     all front-end rendering, charts, adaptive logic
public/style.css  Bloomberg-terminal dark theme
tests/            node:test — 37 tests (lib unit tests + API smoke tests), `npm test`
Dockerfile, render.yaml, scripts/share.sh   deploy + free tunnel
```
Keep pure logic in `src/lib.js` so it stays testable.

## The registries (the key ideas)

### `BENCHMARKS` — the data layer
A flat list of instruments; the whole UI is driven by it. **Adding a commodity = one row.**
Fields: `{ id, label, group, unit, dp, paper (Yahoo futures symbol), physical (FRED/EIA id or null), source }`.
- `physical: null` ⇒ futures-only (metals/ags): price + %, no gap.
- `paper: null` ⇒ spot-only (jet, propane): real price only.
- Current instruments (20): WTI, Brent, RBOB, ULSD, Jet, Propane, NatGas, Gold, Silver, Copper, Platinum, Palladium, Corn, Wheat, Soybeans, Sugar, Coffee, Cocoa, Cotton, **Palm Oil** (Yahoo `CPO=F`, front-month only — no curve).

### `MARKETS` — the segment layer (Big-Picture unit) — **7 segments**
```
crude       Crude oil          WTI + Brent
refined     Refined products   RBOB + ULSD + Jet + Propane   (all fuels merged)
gas         Natural gas        NatGas
precious    Precious metals    Gold + Silver + Platinum + Palladium
industrial  Industrial metals  Copper
grains      Grains             Corn + Wheat + Soybeans
softs       Softs              Sugar + Coffee + Cocoa + Cotton + Palm Oil
```
Each has `primary` (headline instrument), `components`, and capability flags `hasBasis / hasInventories / hasShips / hasCurve / hasCOT`. Exposed at `/api/markets`. The COMMODITIES picker selects a **segment**, and the tiles/chart are scoped to it.

### `MACRO_COUNTRIES` — the macro regions/countries — **6 regions**
```
us     United States
eu     Euro area, Germany, UK, France
jp     Japan
cn     China, Hong Kong
in     India
apac   Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, South Korea, Australia, Taiwan
```
Each country has a verified-live Yahoo `fx` + `index`, a World Bank `iso3`, an `oil` exposure (importer/exporter), and (where available) a BIS `area` for the policy rate. Exposed at `/api/countries`.

## Front-end layout (investor-first, 2 tabs)

**Hero (always visible):** `#headlines` = **live important-headlines board** (`/api/headlines`, tier-1 wire, ranked by event materiality + recency, auto-refresh 10 min).

**Top ticker (`#ticker`):** animated marquee. On **COMMODITIES** it shows all commodities + currencies; on **MACRO** it shows the **full macro tape** (`/api/macro-tickers`, all 34 currencies+indices).

**COMMODITIES tab** (order = decision-first): PICK A SEGMENT + snapshot → **WHAT IT MEANS** (what happened / what's next / trade ideas with benefits-vs-trouble sectors+tickers) → **🔗 HOW IT TRANSMITS** (cross-asset) → **INSTRUMENTS** tiles → **PRICE HISTORY** chart (1M–10Y, hover %) → **PRICES FOR MONTHS AHEAD** curve (follows the segment) → **IS <SEGMENT> TIGHT/STRETCHED** → refined-only **REFINING MARGINS** + **WHO IT HELPS/HURTS** → energy-only **SUPPLY** (inventories/storage) → **🔬 FUNDAMENTALS** (auto-tagged events) → **📰 IN THE NEWS** → folded **SHIPS & SATELLITES** (crude only) → folded **MORE DETAIL** (insights, flags, how-extreme, analogue). Panels tagged `data-when="..."` (market ids, `*` = always) show/hide per segment via `toggleMarketBlocks()`.

**MACRO tab:** REGION & COUNTRY picker → **country card dashboard** (Bloomberg-style cards: MARKET / RATES & INFLATION / GROWTH & DEBT / COMMODITY LINKAGE / KEY TAKEAWAYS / CROSS-ASSET) → **CENTRAL BANK RATE** history chart → **CPI** chart → **INDEX vs CURRENCY** chart (both indexed to 100, hover %) → **CURRENCIES** (scoped to the region) → **REGIONAL NEWS** (importance-ranked) → catalysts.

## Data sources (all free)
| Need | Source | Key? |
|---|---|---|
| Futures, FX, indices | Yahoo Finance chart API | no |
| US + euro-area macro (rates, CPI, HICP) | FRED CSV (`fredgraph.csv`) | no |
| Annual fundamentals per country (GDP growth, debt/GDP, CPI, unemployment) | **World Bank** API | no |

## Deploy (Render, free tier)
- Blueprint from GitHub → **auto-deploys on push to `main`** (~2–3 min). Secrets `AISSTREAM_KEY`, `EIA_API_KEY` set in Render.
- Free tier sleeps after 15 min → a cron-job.org ping every 5 min keeps it awake.
- `.env` (local only, git-ignored) holds keys. **No secrets in the repo.**
- Bump `?v=` on `style.css` / `app.js` in `index.html` after front-end changes (the SW is network-first but browsers cache hard).

## Known limitations (do NOT fake these)
1. **Contract-month chains** (roll-adjusted, curve-history) need ~25 Yahoo quotes; Yahoo rate-limits these from Render's IP, so on the host they can be sparse. The curve-history is NYMEX-energy-only and self-hides otherwise.
2. **Real-vs-futures gap** mixes a **lagged official spot** with live futures — flagged in "data checks". Metals/ags have **no free spot → futures-only**.
3. **No free basis or inventories for metals & agriculture** (needs LME/USDA). Labelled, never invented.
4. **International macro on FRED is stale** — only **US** and **euro-area** official macro are current. Japan/China free CPI/GDP lag by 1–3 years → not shown; those countries show market data + headlines instead.
5. **World Bank fundamentals are annual** and can be old (e.g. Indonesia's debt/GDP latest is 2009). Always labelled by year; debt/GDP is suppressed when the year is pre-2018.
6. **Country gaps:** Singapore has **no policy rate** (MAS runs S$NEER FX policy — benchmark is SORA, not wired); Taiwan/Vietnam have no free index and no BIS policy rate; Philippines index isn't free.
7. **AIS in the Gulf is near-dark** → we show activity levels + market-implied stress + reroute inference instead.
8. **Ships/satellites are oil-only.**
9. **News/event tagging is keyword-based** — a prompt to investigate, always linking to the source. Not a verdict. Google News RSS is undocumented and can rate-limit; endpoints self-degrade.
10. Free tier **cold-starts** (~40 s) after idle.

## Conventions / gotchas
- Keep it **compact, plain-English, honest**. Explain *what it means* and *what to watch*. **Never fake a number.**
- **Never** put secrets in the repo. `.env`, `.state.json`, `.reroute.json`, `.flares.json`, `digest.log` are git-ignored.
- After edits: `npm test` (**37 tests**) then `git push` (auto-deploys). Bump the `?v=` query in `index.html`.
- The service worker (`public/sw.js`) is **network-first** — don't make it cache-first.
- **Front-end request guards matter**: `loadCountry`/`loadCountryChart`/`loadMacroNews` capture `req` and bail if the selection changed, so a slow earlier response can't overwrite the newer choice. The client also caches country payloads (`countryCache`, 5 min) and **prefetches the region** so switching is instant.
- `server.js` is large; keep pure logic in `src/lib.js`.

## Roadmap — investor backlog (do these ONE AT A TIME; each = code + tests + deploy)
Agreed order (impact-weighted):
1. **Deltas + freshness everywhere** — every number shows chg vs 1d/1w/1m/YTD/1y, plus a source + as-of badge. *(Highest value; upgrades every panel.)*
2. **Fundamental "stretch" score** — rebuild the score from curve + basis + inventories-vs-seasonal (not just price range/vol), or rename it "price stretch".
3. **Watchlist + Alerts home screen** — pin instruments, one board, alerts firing (the alert engine + `/api/alerts`/`/api/digest` already exist but are buried).
4. **On-screen daily brief** — "what happened / what's on today" in 60 seconds (digest backend exists).
5. **Compare / spread charts** — overlay two series (Brent–WTI, oil vs dollar, gold vs real yields), % view.
6. **Seasonality surfaced** — a "vs 5-yr seasonal" grade for gas/grains/softs (the seasonal band already exists in the 6M chart).
7. **Numeric curve & carry** — calendar spreads + implied roll yield in $ terms.
8. **Collapse redundant reads** — merge Key Takeaways + What it means + Reading the numbers + How extreme into one read + a detail fold.
9. **Single macro picker** (region+country → one grouped country picker) and merge the 3 country charts into one small multi-panel.

### Remaining polish
- Accessibility pass (keyboard nav, contrast, aria).
- Regional refining margins (USGC/NWE/Singapore).
- Dead code: `renderKPIs`, `renderRegime`, `renderBottomLine`, `renderTightness`, `renderContext`, `computeAlerts` remain defined but unused after the adaptive rewrite — safe to delete.

## Recent work log (this build)
Commodity Desk rebranded from the oil-only "Oil Basis"; merged COMMODITIES+PRICE TRENDS; ranges 1M–10Y with hover %; currencies chartable; Phase 3 global macro (rates, FX, commodity↔currency links, copper/gold).
